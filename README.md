Using the form information, create the username with:

1. First two letters of the firstname +
2. Last two letters of the lastname +
3. Index of the selected Beatle (0 or 1 or 2 or 3) +
4. First two letters and last letter of the selected Beatles name.

###Extra:
Write the new user info to a DB table.

###Extra Extra:
Retrieve the user information from the Database.

**Notes:**
If the student has a different database they would prefer to use, they can modify the form to 
conform to their database and generate a string using a different set of requirements that match up with 
the information they're collecting.

The expectation is that the student will be using classes to encapsulate their code.
